          <strong>About Me</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack web developer, passionate about turning ideas into
          reality. I enjoy the logical puzzles that come with software
          engineering and the process of building things from scratch, taking
          pride in writting elegant, dry code. I am excited to apply the skills
          I've built as a developer in an environment where I can grow as a
          professional and make a positive impact as a team member.
        </p>
        <p className='sm-hide'>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy spending my time working on various cooking
          projects, playing an unhealthy amount of chess or grinding away in the
          woodshop.
